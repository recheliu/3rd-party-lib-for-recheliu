This repo collects several legacy versions of public libraries for my own research code. Please check the [Credits](https://sites.google.com/site/wikiforrecheliusprojects/3rd-party-lib-for-recheliu#TOC-Credits) for the detail list.

**NOTE**: I do not write/own the code. What I mainly did is adding/modifying the configure files so they can be 1) configured by CMake, and 2) built as 64 Configuration by Visual Studio 2005/2008/2010.

PLEASE Contact me if you feel that this project violates any copyright issue. I will react ASAP.

The documents will be maintained [here](https://sites.google.com/site/wikiforrecheliusprojects/3rd-party-lib-for-recheliu), not the wiki.
